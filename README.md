Technologies Used

* HTML

Code Explanation

* I created variables for the target number, user score, crystals, wins, & losses

* For the crystals variable I used an array. For each index of the array i gave it a value from 1-12 using math.random.

I then used a for loop to give each value in the array the same image and class.

* I used an "click" function to make it that each time an individual crystal was clicked the user score would go up by that amount.

* For all the variables I used Jquery methods to send the information to the html file.
